### Hi there 👋

My name is Robin Kiplangat, a social entrepreneur and engineer.

**4bic/4bic** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->
Currently, I am an Investigative data analyst and researcher with [Code For Africa](https://github.com/CodeForAfrica) working on 
on projects around :
- Tackling online disinformation
- Conducting Trainings on Data Driven Journalism and 
- Working on opensource platforms that seek to [liberate data across Africa](https://data.connectedafrica.net/).

I am really passionate about working in the social sector  as it provides an avenue to work on problems whose solutions 
impact livelihood either directly or indirectly and this a huge motivation. 

Through my experience working on civic projects for the past 4 years,  I have come to see how technology and society intersect, 
bringing about a rise in the diversity and new challenges that ought to be adopted and/ or addressed. 

🤔 I’m workig at increasing my depth with understanding foundations in ML with a keen interest to further my research 
and advance data science expertise .
