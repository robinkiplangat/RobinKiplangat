Currently, I am data analyst / engineer  and products with [Code For Africa](https://github.com/CodeForAfrica) working on 
on projects around :
- Tackling online disinformation

I am really passionate about working in the social sector  as it provides an avenue to work on problems whose solutions 
impact livelihood either directly or indirectly.  

Through my experience working on civic projects for the past 4 years,  I have deep understanding of how technology and society intersect,
